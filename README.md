API for Local Area Unemployment Statistics. Features collected included county name, year(1990-2020), 
month, number of unemployed people, unemployment rate

https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-geographic-boundaries
ERSI .shp file that consists of the boundary coordinates for every county in CA. 

Output:
This Shiny app maps unemployment percentage and unemployment numbers for every month
from January 1990 - present. It also provides county profiles that highlight the annual (1990-2020) and monthly (2016-2020) unemployment trends in recent history.

In the future this app will be updated monthly, as the EDD continues to publish unemployment data.
